Locators:
    - Locators are a superset of URLs.
    - They are composed of two major parts:
        - type: The protocol (http:, ftp:, urlencoded:, lzstring:, buffer:, etc).
        - data: The "payload." The type determines how to decode this part.
        The type is optional and defaults to urlencoded.
